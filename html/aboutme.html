        <p class="space">Hello! I am Robert Edward Duncan Jr. I am a boyfriend, doggy dad, art enthusiast, leader and developer. I have lived in Atlanta, Georgia for 6 years and currently live in the Emory Hills neighborhood. Before moving to Atlanta, I lived in Leesburg, GA home of the Trojans, Luke Bryan (country singer), Buster Posey (catcher for the San Francisco Giants) and Phillip Phillips (winner of American Idol season 11). In highschool I was in the marching band and a founding member of the our Math Team. I like to play Fortnite, minecraft and binge watch shows on netflix when I'm not working or coding. Oh, I also enjoying a bright sunny day in the park :)</p>

      <div class="aboutme">
        <p class="space">I have a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from The University of Georgia. During my senior year and the six months after graduation I worked in two psychology research labs. I oversaw experiments and helped process data for the Clinical Psychology and Neuro-Psychology labs. During this time I realized doing research in a lab all day was not something I wanted to pursue further. I am currently working as the Director of Operations for PalmerHouse Properties. Before getting into corporate operations, I worked in retail sales as a Visual Merchandising Manager. I have worked for American Eagle Outfitters, LOFT, Pottery Barn and Restoration Hardware.</p>

      <div class="aboutme">
        <p class="space">Before beginning my retail career in college, I was the student leader for TealSound Drum & Bugle Corps. Think of it as a professional marching band without the woodwind section. In 2006, I was chosen to the be the Drum Major and student leader. It was a major adjustment, especially since it was my first time ever having a position like this. It sparked my fire for leadership and our staff helped me hone my skills as a leader. I returned every year for five years as the drum major. During this tenure, I led TealSound to a bronze medal finish in 2007 and then in 2010 led them as they transitioned from Open Class competition to World Class competition.</p>
